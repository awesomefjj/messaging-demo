# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# apps_name = %i[desk api ping app]
# apps_name.each do |name|
#   app = App.find_or_initialize_by(name: name)
#   app.save
# end
